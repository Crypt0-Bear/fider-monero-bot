## Bounty Scope

### What is Monero Bounties ?
Monero Bounties is a website that designed to help foster community feedback from users, developers and community stakeholders and provide an additional method to crowd fund community projects. Users can post suggestions for suggested improvements in the monero community. Example suggestions could be (but not limited) to the following:

  * Features reqeusts to existing software
  * New software creation 
  * Research funding into new crypographic requirements 
  * Art projects that carry the ethos of Monero
  * Translations of documentation of explainer videos 
  * Website or service that should exist

Every posted suggestion will have an assosiated Monero subaddress generated which can be used to both incentivize and prioratize the community needs for a specific submitted suggestion. These suggestions can be worked on by anybody including the original poster or anonymous individuals. Funds are held in escrow and released once a submitted bounty is completed. There are no associated platform fees and the website is administrered by volunteers (Volunteers may accept donations)

## Bounty Scope

### What is Monero Bounties ?
Monero Bounties is a website designed to foster community feedback from users, developers and community stakeholders. It is supplemental / complementary to the existing Monero CCS (Community Crowdfunding System). Users can post bounties for suggested improvements in the monero community. Example bounties could be (but not limited) to the following:

  * Feature reqeusts to existing software
  * New software creation 
  * Research funding into new crypographic requirements 
  * Art projects that promote Monero
  * Translations of documentation or explainer videos 
  * Website or service that should exist (FOSS)

Every posted bounty will have an associated Monero subaddress generated which is used to both incentivize and prioratize community needs. The bounties can be worked on by anybody including the original poster or anonymous individuals. Funds are held in escrow and released once a submitted bounty is complete. There are no associated platform fees and the website is administrered by volunteers (volunteers may accept donations).

### Bounties Payout 

The open nature of accepted bounties can often make defining a specific deliverable difficult. Submissions require a tightly defined deliverable which helps dictate when a submission can be considered ("completed")[https://bounties.monero.social/?view=completed] and a bounty can be paid out. Submissions lacking a properly defined deliverable will be tagged as ("undefined")[https://bounties.monero.social/?tags=undefined] by reviewers* and will involve any site visitor to help define the payout criteria more clearly. 

Once the bounty is complete a comment should be left by the bounty hunter including a link to the deliverable and a statement on how each payout criteria was met. Any site visitor can leave a comment to either reaffirm or raise any concerns involving whether the bounty should be considered complete or not. Discussion will be considered on outside platforms, including Reddit and the Monero Matrix Channels.
The reviewers* will contact the escrow holder to release funds, once consensus is reached.

## Funding policy 

Bounties which have been reviewed and accepted by *reviewers and the site visitors will remain open for a year. After one year of no shown progress the funds raised for *expired bounties will be transfered to whichever bounty on the site has the most funding at that time. A comment will be added in the expired bounty that states funds were transferred to a particular bounty. Lastly, the expired bounty will be tagged as ("expired")[https://bounties.monero.social/?tags=expired].

If a bounty hunter would like to work on an expired bounty, they would leave a comment and then a reviewer would remove the "expired" tag. If any funds were previously transferred out of the expired bounty to another bounty, those funds will not be relocated back to the original bounty.



## Definitions
Reviewers = Granted the collaborator role within Fider (who though?)
Expired bounties = bounties that have not been worked on for one year (if work is being done in stealth, progress has to be shown before a year passes)

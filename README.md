## Site Description / announcement draft:

Monero Suggestions is a website that will be used to gather feedback from Monero users, developers, and community stakeholders.
Posting suggestions aren't limited to software development or one specific project.
Each suggestion should have clearly defined outcomes, as each post will have an associated Monero Subaddress that will payout to the individual(s) who met the post requirements.
Suggestions can be worked by the original poster or anyone else, including anonymous individuals. (Onion address pending)

The site's intentions are to supplement existing funding methods.
By associating a bounty with a suggestion the community can incentivize / express its priorities.
Bounties are also useful in attracting new developers that may not know specific features or Monero related projects to work on.
Monero Suggestions acts as an escrow for the funded bounties, there are no associated platform fees and the website is administered by volunteers (whom may accept donations).

## Policy Document Draft:
